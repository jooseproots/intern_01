INTRODUCTION

This project encompasses three distinct tasks for the RMK internship.
The tasks include generating test data, creating a graphical representation of a database schema, and refactoring a script for improved maintainability. The following sections provide information on each task and the corresponding solutions.


TASK 1: GENERATING TEST DATA

The goal of this task was to create a Jupyter notebook capable of generating Parquet files containing dummy data for evaluating the performance of various data processing frameworks. A separate file for the data generator has been added.


TASK 2: GRAPHING DATABASE SCHEMAS

This task involves creating a test representation of a database entity-relationship diagram with a minimum of 20 tables using a Mermaid chart. The task was successful and pros and cons of Mermaid charts and the diagram have been listed in the Jupyter notebook.


TASK 3: REFACTORING A SCRIPT

The objective of this task was to refactor an existing script, prioritizing maintainability and clarity. The refactored script adheres to proper naming, formatting, and documentation practices. Issues such as unclear variable names and missing documentation have been addressed to improve the script's clarity and maintainability. The refactored script and the potential purpose of it have been added to the Jupyter notebook.
